<h1>Welcome to the Pygos demo network!</h1>
<p>This page is served by the Nginx server on a Pygos based router and can
  only be accessed from the internal network interfaces.</p>

<p>A lot more work has to be done to turn this into a more usefull landing
  page or a web interface for configuring the router.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for trying out Pygos.</em></p>
